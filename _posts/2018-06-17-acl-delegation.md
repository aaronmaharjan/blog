I am reflecting on the delegation of ACL, In the second half of the semester I really wanted to let the other team members shine by them having a unique project to call their own but unfortunately this idea of showcasing the individuals didn't work as I had planned, ACL was a priority and Matt and Aleen couldn't work on the HelpPage or default Jekyll OP page as they had to be pulled back onto ACL to ensure more success for the showcase. I reflect on issues in logistimate development in a different chapter pertaining to preparation issues and time issues to have it fully complete by the end of the semester. Albert and Abdel did have some more unique things they worked on within ACL as did Matt and Aleen to a smaller scale. I think Ray having his own project from the start of the semester allowed the neccessary time to development something fully and also having it planned more concretely with David driving it.

The Web team still made it to Showcase with the main project and Ray with webcrawlers.

I note what possibly could be done better in the blog on logistimate.
