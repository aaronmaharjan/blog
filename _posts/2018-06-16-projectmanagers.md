I am quite happy with the role of a project manager and felt it was a big learning role as It is a bit out of left field compared to what I did expect in this degree.
I found working with both Robs and Adon very easy and for the most part working with Michael easy as well. I felt I contributed to all the groups I was a part of.

I did a lot of setting up and managing meetings and other tasks for all three teams.

There was an issue near the end of the semester with Michael as he was under stress and the stress got to him.
First incident was him publicly calling me and Rob out for a task which was meant to be done for Rob anyway, this was during project class. I didn't take offence to this but most people did note how it was slightly out of order, I thought this could have been easily solved between the project managers and did not need to be publicly discussed but with the deed being done I let it pass my mind. I gathered the information needed for APT Marketing:

Ops/sec, I talked with Olufemi and he sent me a blurb, I proofread it but it looked fine and sent this to Rob.
GameDev, I talked with the team and decided I'd write this one myself, I shared this with the team and they were happy with it.. I then sent this to Rob.
WebDev, I talked with the team and said i'd do it but then Abdel offered to do it so I said that's fine and thanks, and to send it to a project manager when he's done.

I then took it upon myself to talk with Gray, Tom and Steph about their projects in Machine Learning and recieved two blurbs and wrote one myself and sent these to Rob.

Thinking all was dealt with I didn't think more of this until my phone pinged and I read Michael's posts. I quickly replied to him privately to ask him to settle our differences privately. I also replied publicly as that was the forum he had already taken and let it be known that it was not ok to define other project managers as lazy.

The rest of the conversation was held privately and we came to an understanding.

I think in hindsight I should have seen the second outburst coming as since he had already done it once there is likely to be a second outburst.
I do take some responsibility as I could have prevented both outbursts with greater communication but I think it is also something that allows us students to learn. I don't expect Michael to make the same mistakes with outbursts in the future which is an important lesson and I should also be more attentive to the pressure my peers are facing and communicate efficiently all the time so there cannot be misunderstandings.
