There were five speakers(4 topics and two speakers spoke on the same topic) at today's CodeCraft meetup

The first speakers were Jacob Manning and Abbe Hyde.
I recognized the two from Startup Weekend as they were mentors at startup weekend and greeted them when they noticed me too, I didn't realize they were coming here to speak. Abbe was actually very helpful at startup weekend as after the official scheduled practice pitches were done with Abbe spent more time with me and my team while I continued the practice the speech and helped me with my speech phenomenally. 

They spoke about creating a link between real world and graduates where graduates could work under a senior developer and gain work expierence as it is a hard to come by thing by most job requirements is that you are already expierenced! I thought this was a good idea and I understand there are similar services elsewhere in New Zealand but none in Dunedin. I will be keeping my eye on Jake and Abbe to see if this takes off as it could be useful for me in the future.

The next two speakers were industry types, one talked about React.js and the other talked about ReasonML.. Both these talks were actually quite long and were very technically inclined.. I found myself getting quite sleepy as was struggling to keep up with their topics. Unfortunately I didn't have the knowledge to follow the finer details of what they were talking about. Albert Gao who spoke first about React.js did have the more interesting speech but seemed to be a solution tailored specifically for him in his line of work rather than a general library where the techniques would benefit everyone.

Finally Kylie Jackson from Signal ICT spoke about TechWeek2018 and all the different opportunities at Signal ICT and the events that were upcoming during TechWeek2018.



Here It shows I indeed RSVP'd to the event.
