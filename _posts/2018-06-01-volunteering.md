On Friday me and Rob went out to South Dunedin Community Centre to volunteer upto two hours of our time.
I wasn't sure what to expect when we arrived but the Lady there quickly explained to us what kind of things we would be doing.
We would be helping with any techy issues people may be having in terms of learning to use the internet, such as how to watch videos on TVNZ on demand.
We would also be helping many people with using word, and making a CV on it. She took us through the kind of template she would want us to guide them through and also a checklist of skills, a large checklist of skills the people we work with could tick off.

As I previously said the day was slightly uneventful as the program has just started and not too many people had heard about it yet.
I thought this was a really good initiative and was happy to spend time volunteering as it had been a while since the last time I volunteered. 
We took some I-Pads with us but was not really required.. I think the next time I will bring my Laptop to work on when I am not needed as there will be a bunch of downtime, this is also what the Lady recommended.
