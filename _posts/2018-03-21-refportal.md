Today Adon and I met with Lin, Leslie and Diane about possibly progressing with the RefHub software engineering project form last semester.

The Scope of the project would be quite large with many Marae groups and other ethnic groups connected by the webpage.
There were many angles which were talked about that can be seen in the initial notes linked below.
The main points was to possibly use students in our own department or in the Polytechnic in general to help direct the site and then validate the product before moving forward and expanding to the larger previously mentioned groups of people.

Ownership was discussed here, It sounded like it would be local non government companies that would become the owners of this type of site. 
We also discussed what platforms it may appear on. Whether to have it also as a mobile app, or just as a webpage with mobile compability or simply a facebook page.

There was definitely a large scope as we talked through all the different ways it could help or be built. I was quite happy that a project I was previously working on was being looked at and potentially further implemented. I was quick to find Olufemi who is now working in the Operations and Security team but was also working on RefHub last Semester and share with him the delightful news that this meeting occured and there was some interest in our previous project.
