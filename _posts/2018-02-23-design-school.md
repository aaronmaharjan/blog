Today I attended a meeting with Adon and Martin, Martin who is from the Design School.

I came into this meeting a bit like a fish out of water and was prepared to mainly make notes for Adon.

We discussed a few different topics however only two of which were of any interest to me. The first was a webpage for a local Church which was quickly snapped out of our hands by Martin as he stated how the design school could use wordpress to build the site quick and efficiently. So we let this webpage slide into the hands of the Design School. The other interesting topic that was discussed was Art and Ocean.

Art and Ocean was an idea to have an interactive floor projection using sensors for end of year showcase. This would be a collaboration between the design school and BIT to set up the event and would also require some outside intelligence from artists and scientists/marine biologists. I thought this was a really great idea but I feel it would somewhat be easier to execute as augmented reality and have some VR equipment/special glasses. This is something I want to bring back up to Adon for the next semester.

Why I thought Augmented Reality would be a nice solution would be that with projection when people get in the way they will cast a shadow. We would still want some kind of sensors if we want the Augmented Reality to interact with the people interacting with the environment. Augmented Reality is also a cooler.. yes I used the word cooler because it really is and also Modern approach to the idea that was raised. It would come with it's own challenges but everyone with a somewhat modern smartphone could participate. 

Here is an example of Augmented reality during a very popular eSport Opening Ceremony. You only have to watch for about a minute for it to appear.. or you can skip to 2:55.

As I reflect on this meeting I felt we gave up on the Church webpage too easily, while I understand how it does not require special attention and it can be completed by the design school it was also a project where the clients were not fussy, and didn't have great tech understanding or time restrictions. I felt like it was an opportunity to really WOW some non-techy guys and would have been a website where the specifications could have been directed by myself/Adon to the web dev team as a type or challenge. Also We have many people on Aviation currently and it could be another solo project like Ray has undertaken. I think in the perspective of freedom to set a challenge it was a good opportunity but it was probably best that it did end up with the Design School as the site required didn't need to WOW the clients and creating it in wordpress and having simple specs allows it to be complete much faster than it would have been had we taken it.
