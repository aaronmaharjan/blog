The Startup Weekend

It started on friday with many individuals making pitches of their ideas.

After the pitches we all grouped with the ideas we most liked and gave stickers to the "best" ideas and groups formed around the most popular ideas.
There were about 20-30 ideas but not all had groups form around them, those who didn't manage to gain a group ended up joining other ideas. I didn't pitch any idea and I ended up joining Abdullah's Group for the timesheeting system. 

There were some other groups I considered joining and likely would have if I had not already came with the idea I would join Abdullah.

There was someone with food diversity, like purple green carrots which are good for you... BioDiverse foods!. Interesting.. THat would have been the group I would have joined if I didn't join Abdullah.

Now that the groups were decided My team was Myself, Abdullah, Chris a videographer, Kezz a business owner and Robin a fellow student here at the polytechnic.

On Friday we worked through the plan of what exactly we would develop and present. We did a lot of planning, research and started on Market Validation. We used the lean canvas model.

On Saturday we met with multiple people from the target industry to complete our Market Validation. We met with a Senior project manager who also owns a construction company in Christchurch, Abdullah's Boss who owns Hallbros.. The company Abdullah works for, a couple of labourers and Donna who was a organizer of the event but also a business advisor who has dealt with many management solutions. Robin and I worked on developing for the most part but I was somewhat distracted unlike Robin as I was also helping with the management side of things and involved in some of the interviews. Robin was solely focused on developing.

On Sunday we were approaching the five minute pitches and we had heavy criticism of our current pitches as we tried having everyone doa  small part(VERY BAD THEY SAID)

Then we chose our best speaker... Which happened to be me.. Unfortunately Abdullah who is fluent in english still has a small accent and speaks very fast so as the next person most familiar with the idea and a good speaker I was up or delivery the speech. I spent most of the Friday inbetween seeing how the progress was on Robin's end and practicing the speech and getting criticism and further adapting the speech until the last second.

Development:
I created a a createtables files and another .php file which acts as a controller that relayed information from the android app(created in android studio by Robin) with the database I created. I think me and Robin did quite a good job to have an actual app working that had gps working and sent gps information connected to a user within the timeframe we had and pressure we were working under.

I don't have the code currently for the android App but there are some pictures of the my folder from startup weekend and pictures of some code and a video demonstration of the app.. Unfortunately we usually have me narrating over it but it simply just has a user log in, swipe in to clock in and send the time and location when they clocked in and then the same for clocking out, here we already have the user logged in and yes there is a spelling error... we were in a rush and didn't bother fixing it..:
