Upgrade!!!

Today I followed up on previous discussions with Rob about helping moving some equipment from the other end of the polytech to D block. I met with Hamish and worked with him to move a bunch of computers for him. This resulted in me having access to look at the equipment/Monitors that were gathering Dust and found a lot of them were huge upgrades to some of the screens we were currently using. I went through and looked at those who were stuck with the worst screens and replaced one of the screens with an upgrade which was a 1080p screen.

The reason for all this was some people had two good screens(1080P) and some people were stuck with two (720p) screens which just seemed unfair.. So I had asked Rob(sysAdmin) about getting upgrades and he directed me to Hamish. From there I helped moved and setup some of the new larger screens so that more people had atleast one good screen(no one was left with two 720p) screens. I also made note of the IDs of the new screens and handed this information over to Rob as he has to log them. For transporting the equipment I did enlist the help of some of my Web Dev team members who were present in the project room.

Here is an image where I go through and mark people with numbers, this plan is a dual purpose plan as it also highlights who will have SSD upgrades as well as current levels of good screens.. 0 indicates no good screens.
