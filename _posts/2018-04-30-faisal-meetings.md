Abdullah Faisal is a mutual friend I met through a highschool friend who recently graduated. He contacted me about startup weekend and we decided we would both attend.

We spent multiple nights discussing his idea and how he should pitch it at start up weekend however we didn't start any development or business plans for it would invalidate us as competitors during start up weekend.

During the meetings we discussed the idea and how he should deliver his pitch. How possible it would be to actually develop and other things..
This idea was a construction management app, an automated timesheeting application which would specifically target the construction industry.

I can't link the file itself but the Things we talked about were the specific features of the app. 

Extra notes stuff like what we could further research and known competitors.

I had a practice question session for him(we thought the inital pitches would have questions... they didn't..)

and then some look at what kind of users would be involved. We didn't refer to this material again when doing the start up weekend because we didn't want to hand this out publicly and it might disqualify us.
