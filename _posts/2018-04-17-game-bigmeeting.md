I have been tasked with another project group:

The Game Development Team.

I have quickly caught up with what they are working on. Luckily I am familiar with the games they are basing their current game on.
I think Game Development is a good group for me as I do have expierence and interest in this department.

I am familarizing myself with the group further and got their current tasks listed and am now tracking progress on these tasks.
This was Rob's group previously and they have made some progress on their game by having some models loaded and a world set. I was discussing with Sam about some models that we could buy and was looking at whether the polytech will cover the costs. Now it was only $5 so we can buy it ourselves no problem but It did bring to light something I haven't really thought about.. which is what exactly is our budget here as a project group? I went around asking about how we would get reimbursed if it was possible for work we do directly linked to project but didn't hear anything formal back.

Adon told Sam to just buy it and so Sam did.
I'm not too sure how exactly to approach the group so I simply started by seeing what they were currently doing and what their immediate plans were, they didn't have merging as a plan so I added that to the list of things we should aim to do!

After gaining a better understanding of the game dev group I have set up a Long meeting to talk about multiple agenda items.

In the meeting I talked about Branching and Merging.
Possibly starting a Dev Blog/Patch Notes like a real game would.
Timesheets to better track individual time spent on project.
Design Team Assets. That this would not be available until next semester.
Showcase Product
And Detailed Holiday Work they can complete.

These can be viewed in more detail in the following document.

I felt having a big plan being set up from early on would be a good way to look at the project at hand and also starting the discussion on what will we end up showing at showcase is helpful so we have an end goal for the semester in mind as the end goal of the game is too far out of scope for one semester. I think the team responded well to the large meeting to put things into perspective of where we will end up at the end of the semester.
