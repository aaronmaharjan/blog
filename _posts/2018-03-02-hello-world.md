We were introduced to the class and the different groups that are available. I have an interested in the web development group, David's group which would work well with my DSMI class that I am taking. Adon has also put to light a new group known as project management which seems interesting. I have ended up deciding with some influence from Adon to become a project manager and will be in charge of the Web Development group and Operations and security team. I'm quite happy with this as I was easy on which group I ended up with and I still get to be involved with the Web Development group. 

The Web development team has been instructed with two projects so far, firstly we will be continuing with Aviation insurance website from last semester's software engineering class(Albert was a part of the group developing this) and Raymond volunteered to be split off onto another project making a front-end webpage working with Chris on a webscraper. I am quite familiar with the Aviation Insurance website as while I wasn't a part of Albert's group last semester we were friendly and he had shown me the site multiple times before. On the webscraper side of things I was less comfortable but hopefully as I progressed in my own DSMI class I would develop a better understanding of it.

The Operations and Security team has been instructed with responsibilities and projects.

The team is in charge of of keeping the BIT platform and services connected it running without issue and fixing issues if and when they arise. They work with Rob who's office is closeby to succeed in this goal. On top of these responsibilities the team will also undergo a Migration away from AWS, which is short Amazon Web Services. Currently the polytechnic pays an annual fee for using AWS and to save the department money the team will complete a Migration away from the costly service. I am somewhat less comfortable with this group as Systems Administration, Networking and the like are parts of the degree I find myself least expierenced with. Project managing the Web Development team will be an easier task than manging the Ops/Sec team but it is also an opportunity to understand this side of IT better and learn from the team as I work alongside them.
