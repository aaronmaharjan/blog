We are more focused on what we will end up delivering as our showcase product.
We have decided against many of the other features and are in favour of a warging system, Possession system.

We have also come into contact with people about really setting up a game dev company however our focus is on weekly sprints and progressing for showcase.

The one problem I did notice is that with a lot of talk of migration it still isn't occuring and when it does it's not really as it should be.. I think we may need a big refresher on how to work as a group of collaboraters on a github/lab project...
