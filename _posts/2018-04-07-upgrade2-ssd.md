The SSD upgrade was a success on 5/04

The SSD upgrade was planned and organized by me, Rob let me know that we had some new SSDs coming in and would be upgrading the project room computers.
I Set up the time for this where the OPS/SECURITY team would be able to attend and contacted all project students individually to question whether they wanted the upgrade or not and what the upgrade would mean for them. I let them know all local files would be wiped. If you look at the image below you can see everyone ended up wanting the upgrade because fast is good!

We had one delay as sickness meant we didn't have the full Ops team to commence upgrade and delayed to the same time next week and completed the upgrade.

The Blue marks computers that have no people and do not *need* the upgrade but can be upgraded.
The green marks everyone who wanted an upgrade. Grayson who had a mac didn't need the upgrade everyone else wanted it.. however I did have a few people(very few) that didn't want it but I got the feeling this was not because they didn't want the upgrade but I caught them at a time they were somewhat busy/on the move or they felt they would be tasking people with extra work. So I reapproached the few at better times and explained that we are doing all the SSDs at the allocated time and if they wanted to reconsider.. which they did.

I think I had great self reflection here as there was no real reason for people to not want the upgrade unless they couldn't back up some crucial files because they were away or something.. which the people who initially didn't want the upgrade didn't say stuff such as "no thanks" or "no I dont want it" which is a statement which really conveys that they don't want the upgrade but said things more along the lines of "ahh don't worry about it" and "uh, I'm alright thanks" as they were rushing to some destination.
