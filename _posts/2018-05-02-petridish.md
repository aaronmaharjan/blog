I went to an event called Consultant's Corner hosted by Petridish.

This was a great expierence to meet Business people and lawyers and ask questions to professionals who would usually charge and arm or a leg per hour. Very handy for students and a great initiative I wish i knew about earlier.

On the 2nd of May I suited up and went to petridish and attended Consultant's Corner.

I went there with a team member from the startup weekend, Chris and we talked with Aaron Crampton a lawyer and associate at GALLAWAY COOK ALLAN. 

We talked with him and asked him a multitude of questions mainly about IP/Confidentially and Liability. He gave us a handy link where we could make Confidentially Letters on our own without cashing out on a Lawyer. I learned a lot in terms of Law as it relates to Technology in our session with Aaron. He also gave us advice on how on some ways to move forward as a startup which was much appreciated.

During the talks he took notice of my touch typing skills as he's seen touch typing before with minute takers but not while holding a conversation. I never really thought of that as a skill as it's something I've just gradually learned to do but I felt complimented when he brought it up. 

The more important takeaway from the meeting was that if you ever have a great idea you have to be careful about it because enforcing your rights to an idea is very expensive and often not possible for an individual as those type of law suits usually take a long time and with the time money. 

Here is the docx file of the notes I took during the meeting/session.
