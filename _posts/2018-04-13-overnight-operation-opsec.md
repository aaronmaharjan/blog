Overnight Operation is required for the Operations/Security team to allow further progress on Migration away from AWS. This is something we have been nudging at for most of this semester.

Unfortunately this is something we have to arrange with ISS and I have discussed with Rob on multiple occassions and Lee has been attempting contact with ISS but there are delays due to our dependency on ISS.

I feel a bit of frustration as I dont have contacts with people in ISS and when I raise the issue I hear a lot of I've messaged X and we are working on it which lets me believe it will be resolved soon but later we just continue delaying. There is a structural problem somewhere here, It should not be so hard for Me or the operations/SEC team to establish meaningful contact with ISS.
