The first things I started doing as a project manager was retrieving information on each team's availability so that I could set up weekly meetings for each team, and during these weekly meetings I would also take notes. For the Web team we would have weekly meetings before our classes start on 

Discussing with Adon we planned the Aviation Project to be completed in three steps. First Phase was to get the front and back end working so that data was being pushed correctly across all pages. Second Phase was to work with Derek as a step of validation and allow for any changes or additional features for the website. Finally the last phase, Phase 3 would be moving the system beyond the web team, possibly a mobile application or what not.. details not discussed. I relayed this information this information to the team during the next meeting and allocated forms to work on. an excerpt from the Meeting One file linked below.

Current Form allocations:
Albert – Aircraft                             Abdul – Helicopter                             Aleen – SUV 
Zoe - Hanger Keepers liability     Matt - Spray liability                           Raymond: Third party liability
Unallocated forms:
Spray Liability | Equipment


After that was discussed I arranged another meeting but this time with the Web Development team's Client Derek, who the Aviation Insurance website is being built for. In the meeting we discussed our intentions and goals for the site by outlining our three phase plan. We also asked him some questions which were created prior to the meeting which arose from discussion with members from the ACL team.
