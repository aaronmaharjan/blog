The Web Dev Team has merged back together as the uptake of the inhouse management system was not succesful and Matt and Zoe are now working on ACL again.

The Web Dev Team have completed Phase 1 which was getting the front and back end talking to each other and are moving on with Phase 2.

They are adding an extra feature: Report Pages 

These pages take the information from the first forms and are later extracted as PDFs. This allows the Client to have a specific file which instead of just having a bunch of parameters listed, have that data that was input shown in a way so that he can send it off to follow through with the claims.

While the majority of the team are dealing with Report forms Albert and Abdel have also been tasked with different tasks, Abdel will work on PDF extraction and Albert will work on linking forms to a unique ID. So that when someone edits a form he can revisit that and all the data can be linked to that unique ID.

I think the scope of this project is quite large and even though it doesn't seem the most complex from the outside looking in, the amount of code that exists from the previous/original group make the task require a lot of effort and time.
