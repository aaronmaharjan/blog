Refreshed restart.. not really.

The break is over and I feel more exhausted than before the break started. 
I have been in multiple meetings with my Startup team since the weekend talking about how we should move forward.
In the meetings there are only three of the original members, Me, Abdullah and Chris. Robin is still willing to work with the team but is more interested in development itself rather than the other issues we have to deal with before that stage. Our other member Kezz has been quite busy and we have decided the core three for discussion purposes will be myself, Abdullah and Chris.

The Migration for OPS/SEC team has finally stopped being gated by ISS which is a huge success and Lee is working to complete the migration. Femi and Lee are working on the Quantext services and we decided to look at Microsoft Teams instead of MatterMost which Brett is now working on.

Raymond has progressed really well over the break and there is a live site hosted on the server set up by OPS/SEC team. 

I feel like with David running webscraper and OPS/SEC team being well lead by Lee my main focus has been pushed to the Wed Dev team. I do enjoy the current dynamics within the different groups, The OPS/SEC team has Lee as the leader and I just ensure they have the tools they need help them organize themselves. The Web Dev group is much larger and I spend more time managing as a consequence making sure everyone has things to do and progress towards the same goal.
