Matt and Zoe have been shifted away from Aviation Insurance to pursue an inhouse management system. 
This leaves the Aviation team thinner with Aleen Albert and Abdel the remaining members. There was a slight worry amongst them as Aviation Insurance does seem to be a tall order task however Adon made a good point, that there is a measure of similarities between the forms and instead of having them all learn each process, having some that can learn the processes and then repeat them to the similar forms should be a more efficient use of their time. I'm not too familiar with the task that Matt and Zoe have undertaken. There is also an issue which requires lee to look into regarding the inhouse management system which I notified Lee about. 

Shifting Matt and Zoe onto a new system was a good idea as there were probably too many people working on Aviation Insurance given the current task at hand however the shift was not smooth. The dependency was not fixed instantly and required a key to be generated from Lee and given to Matt and Zoe so they could access what they needed to. During this time while Matt and Zoe didn't have the ability to edit the code they spent their time viewing the current system and familiarizing themselves with it. 
I felt like this was our first real hurdle that wasted a while of our time as with development it seems really bad to be dependent on a single person and everyone should constantly have things to do. I was glad Matt and Zoe did try to spend their time understanding what they could given the current access restrictions but I felt If I had a better understanding of Operations and Security I could have pushed for this issue to be resolved faster.

The Operations team while having this task from two of the web team also have been given other tasks. 
We discussed replacing slack as it currently doesn't allow us to see the full archive without a paid plan and we constantly are notified of space issues.. that we are reaching the limits of our storage space and the way slack is setup doesn't allow workspace admins to delete a lot of the data that is being hoarded. This is because even as an Admin a user only has access to channels which the user is within. This means there is no user able to access data in private conversations or all the other channel groups contributing to the hoarding of data and lack of space remaining. This had led to us currently looking at MatterMost as a service to resolve this issue.
