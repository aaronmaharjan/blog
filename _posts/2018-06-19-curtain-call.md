I am happy with what I have learned from project this semester. There are a lot of management techniques I have read about and gained a lot of expierence in working with and being responsible for groups. 

I learned a lot from Lee about Operations and Security while assisting him.
I learned a lot about delegation and balancing resource working with the large WEB DEV team.
I learned a lot about how the workplace can be affected by external factors from the Game Dev team.

I would like to thank my Supervisor Adon Moskal for guiding me during this steep learning curve that is project management and taking me to meetings early on so that I could collect information via spectating.
I also like to thank all members of the groups I was responsible for, for being easy to work with and respectable.
