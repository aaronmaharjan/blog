There has been a lot of progress and regress on this Project. Members: Myself and Zoe Client: AJ

This project came to us during the break and we met with AJ multiple times and stil have more meetings upcoming with him.

Our initial plan was a three phase plan:

Phase1: Onclick popup frontend
Phase2: Data structure, data builder
Phase3: Logic calculation etc

However after a couple of weeks the situation changed and the project was no longer interested in the Frontend popup and was more interested in simply having a webpage which data would be entered.

We changed our plan to have the data in mind first...

Phase1: Setup Database with Data that we can put in ourselves and Data that will always be the same(read into json files)
Phase2: Front End, which would be adapted from the onclick that was being developed before.
Phase3: Logic calculation etc

We have been a bit slower as the changes occured late into the semester and during busier times. Zoe has been spending a lot of time understanding the data structure weaving through the excel file given to us, I also looked through the excel file and it took me a while to understand how it flows.

I think time pressure was a bit too big with the project also changing it's goal midway through..
We also later found out that AJ was not the creator of the excel sheet he has supplied us but it was someone he worked for. 

Reflecting on Logistimate I think I was very enthusiatic in taking on a new project but not critical enough about it.
I know in the future when starting a new project for a client I need to have a much longer debrief and meeting and have preliminary meetings without speaking of accepting or declining potential projects straight away. I think vetting upcoming projects will be something I will be sure to do to make sure the project is well pre-planned and we have a concrete goal before starting development. I think this somewhat relates to ACL as well where we continued with the project without doing a review of the code. Had we spent a bit more time in the planning stage of the project we can improve our productivity greatly during the development stage.
